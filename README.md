This project showcases a simple HTML and CSS-based profile card for Nispal Bhattarai.
The HTML file includes a DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5, character encoding set to UTF-8
, viewport settings for responsiveness, and a link to an external CSS file (`style.css`).
The body of the HTML contains a container `div` which wraps a profile card. The profile
card features a header section with a profile picture and username, a post image, and 
interactive buttons for liking, commenting, sharing, and saving the post. The CSS file
styles the body to center the card on the page and applies various styles to elements
within the card, such as borders, padding, and hover effects for interactive elements.
This webpage serves as a basic example of structuring and styling a web profile card.
